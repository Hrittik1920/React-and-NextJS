# Why React?
- We can use states which means that once we update the varible, it change across the page.
- We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components.
- React use a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation.
- Debugging and maintainance get very easy.
